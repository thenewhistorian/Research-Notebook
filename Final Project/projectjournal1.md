Met with Ben to discuss next steps for the project. He had a few cleaned datasets that we could use a jumping off point
Decided on comparative analysis and canon analysis for our project approach
I added a readme.md file to our repo on Github

Next steps: data-mining for Harvard, Cambridge, McGill
Add gendered column to withgeo-norepeats
If time, work on timeline.js
