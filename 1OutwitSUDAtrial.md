This is how Aristophanes introduces Socrates in Clouds saying, o mortal, o man, o thinker on things which last a day.[1] He says this because he is himself already thinking about divine matters and disdaining human affairs by considering celestial phenomena. Or because Socrates was said to be very like Silenus [ Author, Myth ];[2] for he was both snub-nosed and bald. So [ Aristophanes ] gives him Silenus' phrase in Pindar. For Pindar portraying him conversing with Olympos [ Myth, Place, Place ][3] gave him the following words, "O wretched man, creature of a day, fool, you are talking by boasting to me of money".[4] At the same time too, because Socrates [sc. in Clouds ] already disdains human matters and is himself among the gods,[5] since he was a star-gazer, so [ Aristophanes ] made him talk about that which lives for one day.
