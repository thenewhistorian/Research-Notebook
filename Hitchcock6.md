new resources, beyond text

Hitchcock gives the example of Sarah Durrant.
Her photo/mugshot, her speech, details of her imprisonment, all form something beyond text.
He uses XML markup to differentiate her words and compare them to the words of other older women in the 1800s.
Therefore, digital history can provide a wider berth of information about subjects by incorporating more than just text.
