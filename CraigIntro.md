Hi, my name's [Craig Lord](www.craiglord.ca). I'm a journalist at [Carleton U](www.carleton.ca) with an interest in history: largely social history, but not exclusively. I'm taking [this class](craftingdigitalhistory.ca "Crafting Digital History") because I've learned a fair number of digital stkills working in journalism, and I'd like to a) learn more and b) put them to new uses.  
I've learned a bit about blogging and some basic coding and web design, but I'm interested in the tools and content this class will have us work with. Projects like those we develop during digital history, I think, can have an audience in mainstream media.  
I want to feel more comfortable with finding resources online and taking advantage of the tools out there to interpret and present that material. For example, I really enjoyed the [information visualization reading](http://www.jeffersonbailey.com/speak-to-the-eyes-the-history-and-practice-of-information-visualization/) we did before starting the first module - those expressions of information are immensely interesting to me, and I believe can be to non-historians as well.  
By the end of the course, I want to have a project completed that I can be proud of, and that demonstrates my ability to synthesize information and present it in a compelling format. That's they kind of work I'm hoping to build my career around post-university.
