Hitchcock quotes Lewis Mumford: 
‘… minds unduly fascinated by computers carefully confine themselves to asking only the kind of question that computers can answer...’ 
That's a line from 1962... Kinda cool.

Hitchcock does disagree, but says we do need to consider the nature of digital history projects.
