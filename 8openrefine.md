Open Refine: lets you take tables of data and clean up or "refine" data labels to group and filter together

ie FFP is Firm Fixed Price, etc.

Seems like excel but a bit fancier.

Clustering is very useful - OpenRefine looks for similar characters in a column and ask if you'd like to merge those rows.
