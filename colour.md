Colours:

Complementary colours sit directly across from each other on the wheel
Exaggerates contrast

Analogous are one colour paired with the other two beside it
Pleasing to the human eye, sense of serenity

Triads bring triangular combinations on the wheel
Best for developing harmony, primary background with highlighting in other two

Hues are the twelve purest colours around the wheel
Tinting lightens a colour, mixed with white
Tones are muted colours, mixed with gray
Shades are blackened
