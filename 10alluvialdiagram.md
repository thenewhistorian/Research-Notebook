Alluvial Diagram

Alluvial diagrams allow to represent flows and to see correlations between categorical dimensions, visually linking to the number of elements sharing the same categories. It is useful to see the evolution of cluster (such as the number of people belonging to a specific group). It can also be used to represent bipartite graphs, using each node group as dimensions.

When we add other columns, we see how each entry in that column corresponds to the next.
So, when the first column you choose has a data entry, you see how often it corresponds to the next column's entries, etc. etc.
